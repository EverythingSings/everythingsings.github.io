  <h1>Remnoire</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">An evolving story born from play</p>
</header>

<p class="story-note">This story emerges from a living game world &mdash; played session by session, its outcomes determined by dice and decisions. What follows is not pre-written. It happened.</p>

<article class="chapter" id="ch1">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter One</div>
  <h2>The Pit</h2>

  <p>Darkness first. Then cold stone against bare skin, the taste of blood, and a body that felt borrowed. No name. No memory of how they got there. Just the sound of breathing that wasn't theirs.</p>

  <p>The pit was deep enough that the edges disappeared overhead into gray nothing. Two others were down there. One was massive &mdash; coarse gray-brown fur, dark eyes, ribs cracked and breathing in shallow pulls. The other was small, young, pressed into the corner and trembling. Non-verbal. In shock.</p>

  <p>There was no reason to help them. No memory that said this is who you are, this is what you do. But hands that didn't remember their own name reached for the large one's ribs, felt the misalignment, and knew &mdash; without knowing how &mdash; exactly what to do.</p>

  <p>The big one would later be called Sasquatch, then Bryn. The trembling kid would eventually name themselves Pell. But in the pit, they were just three broken things deciding whether to be broken together or apart.</p>

  <p>They chose together.</p>
</article>

<article class="chapter" id="ch2">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter Two</div>
  <h2>The Trials</h2>

  <p>Above the pit, there were others. A lean woman with sharp eyes and a military bearing took charge before anyone asked her to. She looked at the small, watchful one who'd climbed out last and said: "Wren. Small bird. Watches before it moves." She named Bryn too. Her own name was Mira.</p>

  <p>The trials began. Four of them, ancient and deliberate, like something designed by people who'd had centuries to refine cruelty into precision.</p>

  <p>The first was the Sorting. Stand before the stone arch and speak your deepest fear &mdash; truthfully, or be taken. The ones who lied disappeared. Wren stepped forward and said it without hesitation: "Not doing the most that I can." The arch held. Mira's fear was responsibility &mdash; being the one who decided wrong while others died for it.</p>

  <p>The second trial was Worth. A long passage, winding and hostile, with a gate at the end that wouldn't stay open. Reach it before sundown or don't reach it at all. They reached it. Not everyone did.</p>

  <p>The third was Skill. Each survivor was tested on what they were best at. For Wren, it was medicine. The trial was close &mdash; marginal &mdash; but the hands knew what the mind had forgotten.</p>

  <p>The fourth trial was the Choice. Three doors. Power: receive a gift, but lose all bonds formed in the trials. Service: stay in the Crucible forever, gain purpose. Sacrifice: bleed, keep everyone.</p>

  <p>Mira chose Sacrifice. Cut her palm open without flinching. Bled to keep them all together.</p>

  <p>Wren cheated. Took Power &mdash; but kept the memories anyway. The reward was a pendant made of dark metal, cold as void. Voidsteel, marked with a bisected circle. A key, though to what, nobody said.</p>

  <p>And somewhere behind the stone walls, a woman in gray robes noticed that the results didn't add up.</p>

<article class="chapter" id="ch3">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter Three</div>
  <h2>Millford</h2>

  <p>Freedom was a dirt road leading to a village of thirty families. Millford. Farming country near the Western Crucible, with a smithy, a carpenter, and a tavern called The Hound's Rest.</p>

  <p>Wren built a life there the way you'd build a wall &mdash; one stone at a time, carefully, knowing it might need to hold weight. Took over the healer's cottage from old Yenna. Learned that the hands' knowledge went deep: surgery, herbalism, diagnosis, improvisation. By the fourth month, medicine wasn't just instinct anymore. It was mastery.</p>

  <p>Bryn found work. Pell, still quiet, stayed close. The kid had chosen Wren over the main group during the trials and never explained why. Over months, slowly, they began to speak. Began learning herbs. Named themselves Pell one afternoon, unprompted, like they'd been carrying it and finally set it down.</p>

  <p>Wren bought into the tavern. Twenty percent. Aldric, the innkeeper, became a partner, then something like a friend. Dalla the carpenter's assistant. Tam the smith, whose arm Wren saved. Corin, a fragile apprentice learning medicine. A life. Not a remembered one, but real.</p>

  <p>Then the implant. A hard lump beneath the scalp, found by accident. Wren cut it out &mdash; and memory flooded back in fragments. A name: Kael. An organization: the Circle of the Severed Eye. Infiltrators, information brokers, people who operated in the spaces between powers. Kael had volunteered. Deep cover mission. Infiltrate the trials. Report back.</p>

  <p>The implant had been recording everything. And now it was out, and the Circle would know their operative had gone dark.</p>

  <p>Wren lied to Bryn about the surgery. Said it was nothing. Bryn found out. The trust between them cracked &mdash; didn't break, but cracked. It would take months to mend.</p>

  <p>Sixteen months in Millford. Then a figure in a gray cloak arrived at the trading post, asking questions. Showing drawings.</p>

  <p>Wren sold the tavern share. Left the cottage. Left Corin and Dalla and the guild. Packed light and walked away from the first home that had ever felt like one.</p>
</article>

<article class="chapter" id="ch4">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter Four</div>
  <h2>Thornhaven</h2>

  <p>Hidden in a valley between two ridges, invisible from any road, Thornhaven was where people went to disappear. Forty buildings, a river, sheep on the hillsides. Governed by Elder Vance, who'd had his own history with the Circle and kept it locked behind careful eyes.</p>

  <p>Wren arrived with Bryn and Pell. Started over again. Same pattern: establish a practice, earn trust, build something worth having. But this time, with a difference. This time, Wren trained.</p>

  <p>Old Marsh was a farmer who'd been a soldier in a life he didn't talk about. Wren saved his family from well poisoning on the first night &mdash; pure reflex, reading the symptoms before anyone else noticed. In return, Marsh taught combat. Not offense. Defense: how to survive, how to escape, how to not die when someone faster and meaner cornered you.</p>

  <p>Six months of it. Body hardening. The gap between Wren the healer and Kael the operative narrowing. Bryn trained alongside, steady as always, the cracked trust slowly mending through shared exertion and the quiet honesty of sparring.</p>

  <p>Mira returned. She'd been gone since Millford, searching for her own past, and came back with intelligence: the Crucibles were ancient filtering systems, built thousands of years ago by unknown hands. The Circle had co-opted them, been using them for centuries to identify and recruit operatives. Three Crucibles formed a triangle &mdash; Western, Eastern, Northern &mdash; all connected underground through passages that converged at a place called the Nexus. The pendant Wren had taken was a key to those passages. One of seven. Most lost or destroyed.</p>

  <p>Wren gave Mira the key and eighty marks. Mira hired mercenaries &mdash; the Iron Remnants &mdash; and led an expedition into the Eastern Crucible. She lost one of her people, a woman named Kess. But she opened the sealed passage to the Nexus. And something, deep in the mountain, stirred.</p>

  <p>Mira returned the key and two hundred marks &mdash; Wren's share. Then she left again, heading north to the Library of Essen with a scholar named Jory to research the Circle's true nature.</p>

  <p>Wren buried the key in a sealed clay jar beneath the oldest oak tree in the herb garden. Then Bryn went to the trading post to collect Mira's package and was spotted by Circle agents.</p>

  <p>Another town. Another life built and left behind.</p>
</article>

<article class="chapter" id="ch5">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter Five</div>
  <h2>Saltmere</h2>

  <p>South. As far south as the roads went, to a coast town of two hundred people who harvested salt and salted fish and didn't ask where you came from as long as you pulled your weight.</p>

  <p>Wren invested in salt flats. Bought into a fishing boat. Ran a medical practice on the side. Nine months of steady work, building wealth the way other people build calluses &mdash; through repetition, through showing up.</p>

  <p>The dock fight changed things. Some dispute, blades drawn, and Wren's body moved before the mind caught up. Combat training that was supposed to be defensive looked a lot less defensive when the adrenaline hit. Muscle memory from a life as Kael. A fisherman named Orde saw the whole thing and started asking the wrong questions.</p>

  <p>The cover was fraying. The Circle hadn't reached the southern coast yet, but covers always fray. Wren liquidated everything. Salt rights, boat share, practice. Packed light again.</p>

  <p>Pell was eighteen now. An herbalist in their own right, guild-registered, carrying their own weight exactly as they'd asked to. Bryn hadn't complained once through three towns. Had simply followed, steady and loyal, the something-unspoken between them growing heavier with each departure.</p>

  <p>Three towns. Three lives. All left behind.</p>

<article class="chapter" id="ch6">
  <div class="chapter-number">Chapter Six</div>
  <h2>Vael's Reach</h2>

  <p>Port city. Western coast. Thousands of people and the kind of noise that swallows identities whole. Stone harbor walls and sprawling wooden districts beyond, reeking of salt and industry. The docks, the warrens, midtown with its guild halls, the shelf where the wealthy looked down on everyone else. A city with enough cracks to hide in.</p>

  <p>Wren became Laren. Bryn became Khett. Pell stayed Pell &mdash; no one was looking for a kid.</p>

  <p>A forger named Hassek on Cradle Street made the papers. A former sailmaker's shop in the docks district became home: practice below, loft above, deed under a name that belonged to no one. Pell ran the medical practice as the face. Bryn managed a warehouse share under Khett's name. The income was enough. Barely.</p>

  <p>Seven months in, and for the first time, Wren stopped running forward and started digging in. Hired an operative named Fen &mdash; dockside, with a crew of three &mdash; to run counter-intelligence. Fifteen marks a month for someone to watch the watchers. Because the Circle had found Vael's Reach. Four agents in rented rooms in Midtown, showing drawings, interrogating travelers, wearing gray when they wanted to be seen.</p>

  <p>Kael's training was fully resurfacing now. Body pushed to its old limits through months of dedicated work. Commerce learned from four settlements of building and losing. Tradecraft from a life Wren was only beginning to remember: aliases, proxies, dead drops, the grammar of deception. Wren the healer and Kael the operative were no longer two people. They were becoming the same person &mdash; and neither one knew what that meant.</p>

  <p>The Circle took a man. Wrong man &mdash; not Wren, just someone who looked close enough. Wren couldn't leave it alone. Sent Fen in to free him. It worked, but the Circle was furious. Doubled their security. The net was tightening.</p>

  <p>And somewhere far to the north, in the Library of Essen, Mira and Jory were reading about what the Circle of the Severed Eye truly was. No word had come back. Fourteen months of silence.</p>

  <p>The Western Crucible had gone quiet. No new survivors emerging. Nobody knew why.</p>

  <p>The Eastern Crucible was awake. Something stirred when Mira opened that passage, and whatever it was hadn't gone back to sleep.</p>

  <p>The pendant &mdash; the key &mdash; was still buried under an oak tree in Thornhaven, waiting.</p>

  <p>And Wren, who was also Kael, who was also Laren, sat in a sailmaker's loft above the docks and faced the question that had been following them since the pit: complete the original mission, or defect permanently. Go back to the Circle, or burn the bridge forever.</p>

  <p>Three years of running. Four towns. Every life built from nothing. Every one left behind.</p>

  <p>Not this one. Not yet.</p>
